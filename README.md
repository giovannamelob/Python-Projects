# Financial Data Analysis and Portfolio Optimization Projects

## Repository Overview
This repository contains a collection of projects focused on financial data analysis, portfolio optimization, risk management, and time series forecasting. Each project demonstrates advanced analytical methods applied to real-world financial data, such as calculating risk metrics, building portfolios, and implementing predictive models like ARIMA and GARCH.

## Projects in This Repository

### 2. **AdvancedFinancialMetrics**
- **Description**: Focuses on calculating key financial metrics, like Sharpe Ratios, cumulative returns, and volatility, and adjusts inflation returns.
- **Link**: [AdvancedFinancialMetrics](https://github.com/giovannamelob/Python-Projects/tree/main/AdvancedFinancialMetrics)

### 3. **AdvancedPortfolioAnalysis**
- **Description**: Calculates and visualizes various financial metrics like Sharpe Ratios, cumulative returns, and volatility, and adjusts inflation returns.
- **Link**: [AdvancedPortfolioAnalysis](https://github.com/giovannamelob/Python-Projects/tree/main/AdvancedPortfolioAnalysis)

### 4. **BlackScholesOptionCalculator**
- **Description**: A calculator based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model for European call and put options.
- **Link**: [BlackScholesOptionCalculator](https://github.com/giovannamelob/Python-Projects/tree/main/BlackScholesOptionCalculator)

### 5. **FinancialAnalysisWithGARCH**
- **Description**: Analyzes Berkshire Hathaway's stock performance relative to S&P 500 futures using advanced financial metrics, including the Information Ratio and volatility clustering via GARCH modeling.
- **Link**: [FinancialAnalysisWithGARCH](https://github.com/giovannamelob/Python-Projects/tree/main/FinancialAnalysisWithGARCH)

### 6. **OptimizedPortfolioVaR**
- **Description**: Uses Value at Risk (VaR) minimization to optimize portfolio weights. The project leverages optimization techniques to reduce portfolio risk based on historical asset returns.
- **Link**: [OptimizedPortfolioVaR](https://github.com/giovannamelob/Python-Projects/tree/main/OptimizedPortfolioVaR)

### 7. **Ethereum Time Series Analysis and Forecasting**
- **Description**: Analyzes Ethereum’s price trends using time series decomposition, moving averages, and ARIMA modeling for future price forecasting. The project also explores autocorrelation and seasonality in the data.
- **Link**: [Ethereum Time Series Analysis and Forecasting](https://github.com/giovannamelob/Python-Projects/tree/main/EthereumTimeSeriesAnalysis)

### 8. **RiskMetrics**
- **Description**: A comprehensive project to calculate risk metrics such as VaR, Expected Shortfall (ES), and Delta VaR. It also analyzes risk-adjusted returns and visualizes performance over time.
- **Link**: [RiskMetrics](https://github.com/giovannamelob/Python-Projects/tree/main/RiskMetrics)

### 9. **RiskParityPortfolioAndValidation**
- **Description**: Constructs and validates a risk-parity portfolio, allocating assets based on inverse volatility. The project calculates key performance metrics and evaluates the portfolio’s risk-adjusted returns.
