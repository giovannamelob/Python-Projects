# Advanced Financial Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains Python scripts for performing financial data analysis including return calculations, volatility assessments, and drawdown analyses using `yfinance` to fetch historical data.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations and calculations.
- **matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **yfinance**: For downloading financial data.

## Installation
To install the required Python packages, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Project Details

### Data Retrieval and Analysis
- Fetches and analyzes data for `ES=F` (S&P 500 Futures) and `ZN=F` (10-Year Treasury Futures).
- Calculates cumulative returns, volatility, and maximum drawdowns.
- Visualizes results including return distributions and drawdown plots.

### Statistical Analysis
- Calculates and prints key statistics such as mean daily returns, annualized returns, and standard deviations.
- Provides detailed analysis of portfolio metrics including skewness and kurtosis.
- Includes quizzes and exercises that demonstrate various statistical computations.

### Visualization
- Plots histograms of returns to visualize distribution characteristics.
- Displays cumulative returns and ongoing drawdowns for both individual assets and a combined portfolio.
- Generates rolling Sharpe Ratios to assess changing risk-adjusted returns over time.
